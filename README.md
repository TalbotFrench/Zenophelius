# Zenophelius
A website oriented towards music and creative expression
Implementing code and techniques I learned during my internship which include: 
1. Adjusting and creating containers 
2. Creating Sub Icons in a Nav bar 

3. Utilizing a AnchorButtonsGroup to create consistency across the Web Application.

4. Create a Submit Button through a partialview in the AnchorButtonGroup working with multiple classes that had already been established.
5. match the newly created button to the others in the group for consistency

6. Add Submit button to 12 independent pages to replace the longer solo instance code with the concise and efficient partialview Submit.
